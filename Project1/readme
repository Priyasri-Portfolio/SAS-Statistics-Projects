Overview:

I have made a report based on the observations for the Senic dataset. The code and the report are in the project 1 folder.

SENIC Project: Nosocomial Infection Analysis

This study examines hospital-acquired infection rates in U.S. hospitals using data from the SENIC project. Statistical methods are applied to assess geographic and patient-related factors influencing infection risk.

Statistical Methods:

-ANOVA Tests: Comparing mean infection risk across geographic regions and patient age groups.

-Pairwise Comparisons: Tukey procedure and alternative methods for assessing regional differences.

-Residual Analysis & Transformations: Brown-Forsythe test, Box-Cox transformation, and reciprocal transformations for variance stabilization.

-Model Diagnostics: Checking assumptions and refining models for improved fit.

Dataset:

The dataset consists of infection-related data from 113 hospitals across the United States, 
including patient demographics and hospital attributes.

The dataset can be found in online resources.
