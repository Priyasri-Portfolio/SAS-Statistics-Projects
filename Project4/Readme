Statistical Methods:
-Three-Factor ANOVA: Conditional and averaged interaction plots, Type III tests, and model refinement.

-Model Diagnostics: Residual analysis and assumption checks, including interaction and main effects evaluation.

-Multiple Comparisons: Tukeyâ€™s method and Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons.

-Mixed Effects Modeling: Fixed and random effects estimation using PROC GLM and PROC GLIMMIX.

-Variance Components Analysis: ML and REML estimation for interaction effects and fixed-factor comparisons.
