Overview:

This project builds a multiple linear regression model to predict the death rate per 1,000 
residents across 54 cities. The analysis includes regression diagnostics, model refinement, 
and selection techniques to identify the best predictors.

Dataset: health.csv. The dataset contains health-related statistics from 54 cities, including various predictors 

relevant death rate.

Statistical Methods:

-Regression Modeling: Fit a multiple linear regression using all available predictors.

-Diagnostics & Assumptions: Residual analysis, normality tests, and transformation techniques if needed.

-Feature Selection: Extra sum of squares principle (Type I and III SS), adjusted 
ùëÖ^2, Cp, BIC, and stepwise selection methods.

Model Comparison: Evaluation of different models based on selection criteria.

Final Model Analysis: Multiple and partial correlation/determination coefficients and confidence intervals.
